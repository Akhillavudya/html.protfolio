<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>ello there! I'm a first-year B.Tech student at IIT Guwahati, and I take pride in being honest and hardworking.</p><p> Before this, I completed my 11th and 12th at IIIT Basar, where I laid the groundwork for my academic journey. Besides hitting the books, I find joy in sports like volleyball and kabaddi, where teamwork and strategy are key. Indoor games also have a special place in my heart, offering a fun way to unwind after a long day.</p>

<p> When I'm not studying or playing sports, you can often find me hanging out with my friends. I cherish these moments and love exploring new places with them, soaking in the sights and making memories together. But above all, my family means everything to me, especially my brother. Their love and support are like a rock, guiding me through life's ups and downs. In a nutshell, I'm just a simple guy with a passion for honesty, sports, friendship, travel, and family.</p>
